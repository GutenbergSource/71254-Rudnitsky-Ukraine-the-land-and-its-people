<HTML><BODY><p>The current atrocious war in Ukraine makes me want to add a few historical books about this suffering country. The books will be, out of necessity, old, but provide some historical context to the tragedy we see developing today.</p>
<p>The first book I would like to present is a description of Ukrainian geography and a study of the Ukrainian people from 1918. Originally written in Ukrainian (as Коротка географія України) by Stephen Rudnicki, a professor in Lemberg (Currently known as Lviv. When the book was written part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, transferred to Poland in 1918, to the Soviet Union in 1945). The book was translated (via German) to English.</p>
<p>The name of the author is transcribed in various ways. His full name in Ukrainian is Рудницький Степан Львович. In 1933, the Soviet Union under Stalin convicted him to hard labor for spreading "fascism in geography", he was shot in Karelia in 1937.</p></BODY></HTML>
